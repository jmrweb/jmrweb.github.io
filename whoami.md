# whoami

Hey out there! I am an IT professional with a focus in networking, offensive security, and a sprinkling of DEVOPS.  This is my home on the web for sharing my projects and insights.

I also have a strong interest in service and leadership.  I have had to good fortune to recieve much in the way opportunity and support as well as many second chances in life.  I want to pay that forward by reaching back to bring others with me.

Curently I am focused on studying for the OSCP after completing my  Master's Degree in Cybersecurity.
