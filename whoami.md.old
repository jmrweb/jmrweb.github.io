Hey out there! I am an IT professional with a focus in networking, offensive security, and a sprinkling of DEVOPS.  This is my home on the web for sharing my projects and insights.

I believe passionately in cyber as a national security issue and protecting the US against it's adversaries in the cyber space.  To that end I support the principal of defending forward.  Offense far outpaces defense and our adversaries have taken advantage of that, demonstrating a willingness to conduct cyber attacks and becoming emboldened by their minimal geopolilitcal cost.  We must avoid escalations but these actions warrant targeted pushback through offensive cyber operations.

I also have a strong interest in service and leadership.  I have had to good fortune to recieve much in the way opportunity and support as well as many second chances in life.  I want to pay that forward by reaching back to bring others with me.

Curently I am focused on completing a Master's Degree in Cybersecurity and studying for the OSCP.
