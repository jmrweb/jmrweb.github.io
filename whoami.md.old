Hey out there! I am James Read, a Cybersecurity professional with a focus in networking, offensive security, and DEVOPS.  This is my home on the web for sharing my projects and insights in Cybersecurity.

I believe passionately in cyber as a national security issue and protecting the US against it's adversaries in the cyber space.  I support the principal of defending forward.  Offense far outpaces defence and China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea have demonstrated a willingness use cyber attacks with minimal cost.  While we want to avoid escalations these actions warrant targeted pushback through offensive operations.

I also have a strong interest in service and leadership.  I have had to good fortune to recieve much in the way opportunity and support as well as many second chances in life.  I want to pay that forward by reaching back to bring others with me.

Curently I am focused on completing a Master's Degree in Cybersecurity and studying for the OSCP.

I you are interested in reaching out you can contact me at jmrweb@@protonmail.com
