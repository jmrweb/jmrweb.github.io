# Coastal Virginia Cybersecurity Student Association

I helped founding the CVCSA in 2020 as part of the COVA CCI Innovate Cyber program and currently serve as its Director.

The CVCSA seeks to support Cybersecurity Students throughout coastal Virginia by providing resources and opportunities for students to develop skills, network, and build a regional community.

## CyberForge

The CVCSA recently held its first ever CTF event: CyberForge
