# Coastal Virginia Cybersecurity Student Association

I helped founding the CVCSA in 2020 as part of the COVA CCI Innovate Cyber program and currently serve as its Director.

The CVCSA seeks to support Cybersecurity Students throughout coastal Virginia by providing resources and opportunities for students to develop skills, network, and build a regional community.

Our motto is 'Closing The Gap', helping to bridge the divide between the skills students graduate with and the experience that employers are seeking.

## CyberForge

CVCSA hosts an annual conference called CybeForge.  This two day event brings together students from throughout the region to for speakers, networking, workshops, and a full CTF with over 1000$ in prizes.
